			<h2>Before using Scratch Embed tools on your site, please read over and abide by the following guidelines</h2>
			<h3>Strict Guidleines</h3>
			<h4>Breaking a strict guideline will have you blacklisted from using Scratch Embed in the future</h4>
			<ul>
				<li>Scratch Embed should not be used on innappropriate sites
					<dd>Innappropriate sites include any sites which violate the <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/community_guidelines/" class="inlinelink">Scratch Community Guidelines</a>.</dd>
				</li>
				<li>Do not abuse the service
					<dd>This includes, but isn't limited to: using Scratch Embed on extremely high traffic sites, using large amounts of embeds on a single page, attempting to find exploits in the site, embedding on a page which is constantly refreshing, etc.</dd>
				</li>
			</ul>

			<h3>Flexible Guidelines</h3>
			<h4>Flexible guidleines should be abided by whenever possible, but there is room for a bit of flexibility</h4>
			<ul>
				<li>Try to limit Scratch Embed to 7 embeds per page
					<dd>This ensures that it isn't overwhelmed with requests by a single site</dd>
				</li><br>
			</ul>
			<p>If these guidelines aren't followed by the majority of users, then a whitelist will have to be implemented, where users will have to register sites where Scratch Embed will be allowed to be used.</p>
