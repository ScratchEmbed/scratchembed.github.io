			<p>Thanks for your interest in contributing to Scratch Embed! We are always looking for people to help improve our tools! The GitHub repositories for Scratch Embed can be found under the <a href="https://github.com/ScratchEmbed" class="inlinelink">Scratch Embed</a> organization on GitHub.</p>
			<p> Please make sure that you take a look at our contributing guidelines before you start working. They will help you understand the process that you should follow when contributing to this organization.</p>
			<p>Here is a general summary of our contribution guidelines:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Pull Requests shouldn't be submitted if there isn't an issue that the PR will resolve. Therefore, if you would like to help add a feature or fix a bug, please create an issue, or use our issue or feedback forms.</li><br>
				<li>Please wait for issues to be labelled with a priority label before you start working on them.</li><br>
				<li>If you want to work on an issue, please leave a comment on it asking to work on it, and wait to be assigned to the issue before you begin working on it. This ensures that more than one person isn't working on the same issue.</li><br>
				<li>Please don't work on issues that are labelled "needs discussion", "in progress", or "blocked".</li><br>
				<li>Make sure to follow our style and code guides in order to make sure that your code is consistent with the rest of the project.</li><br>
				<li>When you have completed your work on an issue, please create a Pull Request (make sure to follow the PR template). Also, if this is your first time working on this project, please add your name to the credits page.</li><br>
				<li>Once you submit your PR, wait for it to be reviewed and merged. Depending on how much you have changed, this may take a while. Be Patient!</li><br>
				<li>Your PR might be marked as "needs changes". If this is the case, please read comments left by organization members in order to understand what needs to be fixed.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Thanks again for your interest in contributing to this project!</p>
